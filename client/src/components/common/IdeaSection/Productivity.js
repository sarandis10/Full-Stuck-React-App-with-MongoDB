      <h3>Productivity</h3>
      <p>Being productive at something we all struggle with at some point in our career. As a developer when we start working for a company or a client, most of us get obsessed with coding. We spend a lot of time in front of the computer screen writing the code, fixing the bug, reading about the technical stuff, and trying new things in programming. We enjoy doing it and we spend endless hours in coding even on weekends. A lot of us also start thinking that moving away from our computer simply means we are lazy and we aren&#39;t a hard worker.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimize Distractions</li>

        <li>Master Your IDE</li>
        <li>Work On thr Command Line</li>
        <li>Automate</li>
        <li>Invest Time in Pair Programming and Code Review</li>
        <li>Learn New Skills and Work on New Projects</li>
