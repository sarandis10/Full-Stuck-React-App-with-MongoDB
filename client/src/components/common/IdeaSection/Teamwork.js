      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <p><b>Tools & Training</b> - Most engineers understand the basics of versioning but spending time going through the more advanced aspects including release and environment branching, rollbacks, staging and production configuration, etc. can save a lot of trouble down the line when it comes to maintaining different common repositories and code environments.</p>
      <p><b>Team Structure</b> - Team structure can often affect how smoothly a coding team works together. For example, a team can be split into pairs where a more experienced coder is paired up with a less experienced one. Code reviews can be performed in pairs working on related components to speed up the process. Team structure is a very integrated with the product features and if you&#39;re splitting out coding tasks is essential to consider.</p>
      <p><b>Conventions</b> - Conventions can be any thing from daily meetings (e.g. SCRUM meetings) to go through work components to file and repository structures to tools used in tracking what project milestones and progress (e.g. Pivotal Tracker). Define a brief convention (even a 1-pager would help!) and build consistency into the team.</p>
